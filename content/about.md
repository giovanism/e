> Computer Science, somewhat unfaithful cult of vi member,<br/>
> Can't say that I am a self-proclaimed NEET anymore.<br />

> about helping others on new things and the things I already excel with.
> I’m already familiar with git, Python, C#, Unity3D, Linux, and Docker.
> I'm now working on my skills and knowledge in FOSS, DevOps, Information
> Security, and CTF.
