Hi folks! Today I want to share about eBPF since I tried it out a bit last week.
My friend convinced me to learn it so we can discuss it together. Many people
said that eBPF will be "the next big thing" after Kubernetes and Service Mesh.

So, here's the result of me studying the eBPF documentation.

Or you can access the interactive online version of the mind map
[here](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/1ce0bee805394652be3f4a33fbfad63f).

I don't have much thought eBPF now. I can see a lot of opportunity here, but a
healthy dose of
[skepticism](https://twitter.com/wm/status/1453492551579836417?s=20) is also
needed so we don't blindly follow Hype Driven Development or something similar.

Thank you for reading and please give a comment or feedback!
