Since the start of 2017, I had been thinking about having my own domain name and personal blog. [A](https://laymonage.com/) [few](https://yukiisbo.red/) [friends](https://refeed.github.io/) of mine have one, so I think having one would also be cool. I planned to have a static site real quick using either [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), then buy one cheap domain name so I can tie them using something like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) or [Netifly](https://www.netlify.com/).

After college entrance exam, I had some spare time around the holy month of Ramadhan and my first day in college. I bought [giovanism.id](http://giovanism.id) from [qwords](https://www.qwords.com/). I made the purchase with Ramadhan special [offer](https://blog.qwords.com/2017/06/16/weekend-bagi-bagi-thr-promo-domain-hosting/), so it only costed me around 4$ for the first year. The only problem was that, I bought the domain name first before writing anything. Long story short, I wasn't able to make one until now. What a slouch, and I couldn't even make use of my sweet domain name.

Now, thanks to that regret that this site was born. This site is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with super nice [After Dark](https://github.com/comfusion/after-dark) theme by [Josh Habdas](https://habd.as/). Indeed, you can see it down there in the credits, but I will remove those soon.

It was set up rather plainly with little to no customizations.

  <p>simple, handy, and convenient</p>

That's one way to put it, I guess. Thanks for sticking up right through the end. I promise to __write__ more contents here.
