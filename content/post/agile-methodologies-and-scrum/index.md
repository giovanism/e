Hi! This time on the PPL series of posts I will explain about Agile. As I have
previously mentioned on my other post, in this course we are required to
implement an agile software development methodology, Scrum. As of now, I dont
think we have pulled this of to the level where I want it to be. Hopefully, I
will add more updates and improvements about our process.

## What is Agile?

First, Agile is a __not__ a software development methodology, SDLC (Waterfall,
Prototyping, Spiral, etc.) or the likes. Unlike them, Agile doesnt have a set of
some hard rules to follow. Instead, Agile provides __values and principles__ to
guide us when working with software and client/customer.

These value and principles changes slighly as time passes, but they are more
less the same. There are no exact time when Agile is invented or found. But
there are a points in time where Agile is talked about and published by major
publication to gain enough influence. One such source is [Manifesto for Agile
Software Development][agile-manifesto], or __Agile Manifesto__ for short.

Agile Manifesto is by no means the first ever publication of Agile software
Development, or the most complete one out there. The manifesto itself is
formulated on 2001 by a group of 17 people, representatives ranging from Extreme
Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven
Development, Pragmatic Programming, and vice versa. However, the manifesto has
came up time and time again. I think this can be attributed to how concise,
simple and easy to follow the manifesto is. Even the word `manifesto` is bound
to ring a bell to some people.

## Agile Values

These values is written on their website, but I will stil list them below
for completeness's sake:

- __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools
- __Working software__ over comprehensive documentation
- __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation
- __Responding to change__ over following a plan

## Agile Principles

There are also [Agile Principles][agile-principles]. It consists of 12 loose
principles around Agile Software Development. These principles expand from the
previous values to include more concrete guides not mentioned before such as how
face-to-face conversation is the most effective form of communication.

## Scrum

Here is the textbook definition of Scrum:

{{<blockquote
  text="Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for managing complex work. The framework challenges assumptions of the traditional, sequential approach to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines involved."
  citelink="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Key_ideas"
/>}}

While there are also many resources for Scrum as Agile, I will try to explain
in reference to the [Scrum Guide][scrum-guide] since it has been a great
learning material for me.

Now, what we did on PPL course is __not__ Scrum. It's Scrum, but... hoho.
Someone advice me not to use "but" when I try to explain modification to
existing ideas since it gives of the impression that the original is crippled
to make compromises. Let's give it a redo. It's Scrum, with additional grading
metrics. Yea, thats what I think. Some flow is modified so they are easy to
grade.

## Scrum on Our Team 14/04/2019

### Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools

We're trying.

### Working Software over comprehensive documentation

Yup, our staging environment is working.

### Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation

Ouch!

### Responding to Change over following a plan 

Can't change plan if you dont have any in the first place, lol.
