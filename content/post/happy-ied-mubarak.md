Assalamu'alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh

Happy Ied Mubarak for those who performed shaum as well as those who didn't.

I want to apologize to everyone that I wasn't able to apologize directly or sooner than when I published this post. Social media or broadcast message have never been a place for me to give official statement or personal message. What I had done in the past was to give my sincere apology through direct greeting or at least physical proof.

But this year is different, there are those I hold dear, family and friends alike I can't get my apology to them like before. I've always been clumsy at online communications and the likes. So, I am trying to improve on those. And, I recently put up this [simple site](/) to place my writing from here on.

Wthout further blabbering, I want to say

> I'm really sorry.

To write or say something, is to give shape to one's feelings and convey them to the other person. Still, there many bit and pieces that are better [left unsaid](/page/left-unsaid/).

Even after what I said above, I humbly say that I can't make up all the mistakes that I have done. However, I promise to grow from those and pay them back some way or another.

So, until the time we may meet again.
