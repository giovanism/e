Hi! Now, I'm back again to another post on PPL series. This time I will
breakdown testing and QA process using [SonarQube][sonarqube]. To be honest this
is a very wide subject. There are so much to cover from unit tests to user
acceptance tests, from manual QA to automated QA using tools such as SonarQube,
and other things in between.

## Unit Tests

Someone had said that writing unit tests is more than half the battle to write
good software [citation needed]. I can not agree more with this statement.
Moreover in the age where _Test Driven Development_ has became more prevalent,
writing unit tests has become the norm.

### Good Unit Tests

### Mocking

## Static Analysis

## SonarQube
